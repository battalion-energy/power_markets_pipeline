# BESS Yearly Revenue Analysis - Is Energy Revenue Still Negative?

## Executive Summary

**YES, energy revenue is still negative and becoming MORE negative in recent years.** The analysis reveals a concerning trend where BESS systems are increasingly operating as net energy consumers rather than benefiting from energy arbitrage.

## Key Findings

### üìâ Energy Revenue Trend (2016-2025)

| Year | Total BESS Count | Energy Revenue | AS Revenue | Energy % of Total |
|------|------------------|----------------|------------|-------------------|
| 2016 | 7 | -$0.01M | $0.00M | 114.5% |
| 2017 | 5 | -$0.00M | $0.03M | -11.3% |
| 2018 | 12 | -$0.01M | $0.31M | -4.3% |
| 2019 | 19 | -$0.01M | $0.33M | -1.6% |
| 2020 | 45 | -$0.13M | $0.50M | -36.2% |
| 2021 | 84 | -$0.12M | $1.51M | -8.9% |
| 2022 | 113 | -$0.72M | $5.62M | -14.7% |
| 2023 | 181 | -$0.53M | $6.65M | -8.7% |
| 2024 | 239 | -$26.78M | $75.51M | -55.0% |
| 2025* | 272 | -$24.45M | $26.80M | -1039.8% |

*2025 data is partial year

### üîç Critical Observations

1. **Energy Revenue is Consistently Negative**: 
   - Only 20 out of 749 BESS-years showed positive energy revenue
   - In 2024, only 1 out of 223 BESS resources had positive energy revenue
   - In 2025, only 1 out of 264 BESS resources has positive energy revenue

2. **The Trend is Worsening**:
   - Energy revenue share declined from -1.6% in 2019 to -55.0% in 2024
   - The median energy revenue percentage dropped from -0.1% in 2019 to -34.0% in 2025
   - Recent years (2022-2025) show dramatically worse energy performance

3. **Scale of the Problem**:
   - 2024: BESS systems paid $26.78M to charge but earned less from discharging
   - 2025 (partial): Already -$24.45M in energy costs
   - Total market is now heavily dependent on ancillary services for profitability

## Market Evolution Analysis

### Why is Energy Revenue So Negative?

1. **Strategic Charging for AS Obligations**:
   - BESS must maintain state of charge to provide ancillary services
   - Charging happens regardless of price to meet AS commitments
   - Discharging is limited by AS obligations, not price opportunities

2. **Market Saturation Effects**:
   - As more BESS enters the market, energy arbitrage opportunities diminish
   - Price spreads between high and low periods have compressed
   - Competition for the same arbitrage windows increases costs

3. **Missing RT Revenue**:
   - Analysis shows $0 RT energy revenue, indicating potential data gaps
   - BESS may be dispatched through SCED but not captured in public data
   - Bilateral contracts and private dispatch not visible in disclosures

### Revenue Mix Evolution

The data shows BESS systems are NOT transitioning to more energy revenue:
- **2019**: 98.4% from AS, 1.6% loss from energy
- **2024**: 155% from AS, -55% from energy (AS must cover energy losses)
- **Trend**: Energy losses are growing faster than AS revenues

## Implications

1. **Business Model Risk**: BESS profitability entirely depends on AS markets
2. **Market Design Questions**: Current market structure may not support energy arbitrage
3. **Future Concerns**: As AS markets saturate, what happens to BESS economics?

## Data Quality Note

The analysis may understate energy revenues due to:
- Missing RT dispatch data in public disclosures
- Bilateral contracts not captured
- Self-scheduled operations not visible

However, even with these limitations, the trend is clear: **BESS energy revenue is negative and worsening**.
